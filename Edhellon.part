		<Flavor> This ornamented dagger is always warm to the touch.  Though it is scorched, the masterful gold inlay on the blade appears untouched, spelling the name "Karnayna".  The crude scratching on the reverse side of the blade is also clearly visible, spelling the name "Reki".  When drawn, you hear the call of vengeance, not for yourself, but for the fallen around you. </Flavor>
